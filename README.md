## 📺 Netflix Dataset Analysis

This is my second dataset analysis as part of my personal challenge to explore one dataset every day. In this project, I analyzed the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The aim was to perform basic data cleaning, create visualizations, and uncover trends in Netflix content over the years.

### 🧰 Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

---

### 📌 What I Did
- Cleaned the dataset (handled missing values, formatted columns)  
- Separated the data by content type (Movies vs TV Shows)  
- Grouped data by year and visualized trends  
- Compared the number of Movies and TV Shows added each year

### 🔍 Key Insights
💡 Number of movies added to Netflix peaked in 2017–2018, then gradually declined  
💡 TV shows showed a steady increase until 2020, suggesting a rise in series content  
💡 By 2021, both movies and TV shows saw a drop — likely due to the pandemic's impact on production
